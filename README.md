# ðŸ§  FYProject â€“ Solving NP-Hard Graph Problems

This project demonstrates algorithmic approaches to solve the **Vertex Cover** problemâ€”an NP-hard problemâ€”using Java. It includes a GUI interface to test and visualize the execution of Greedy, Heuristic, Randomized, and Approximation algorithms on graph structures.
